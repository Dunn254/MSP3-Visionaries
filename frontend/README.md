We are working on an ecommerce app. It features eye-wear and we envisioned being the Apple of eyewear...being visioneries...(pun intended).

There is 4 of us. 2 working on the frontend and 2 on the backend.We separated the frontend and backend. For the frontend, we have William Rodriguez(Williiamdr) and Van Hoang(vhoang001). For the backend, we have Marshall(M1lorhan) and Brian Edwards(Dunn254). 

We are using react, node, mongo, and express

we have two components:
-Admin-which stores the admin dashboard files to manage products, orders and users.
-Client-which stores clients dashboard files to manage orders.
